JHU Machine Learning - Regularized Regression

Prostate Cancer Data Set Example

```{r}
library(ElemStatLearn); data(prostate)
str(prostate)
```

 An issue of high-dimenstional data:

```{r}
small = prostate[1:5,]
lm(lpsa ~. , data=small)
```

- NA values appear because R cannot estimate because you have more predictors than you have samples; this is because the design matrix cannot be inverted
